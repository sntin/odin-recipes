    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These crustless grilled cheese sandwiches are great to have stashed in the freezer for when the kids need a quick snack. Easy for little hands to hold, with the cheese sealed inside and no tough crusts, theyâ€™re fun for them and convenient for you.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices white sandwich bread</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons softened butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of butter onto 1 side of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly smaller than the sandwich sealer, press out round slices of cheese. Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface, buttered side down. Place a cheese round in the center of each slice. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich, press the sealer down, and hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to 30 seconds. Pull the crusts away from the sealer; discard. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.</li>
        <li>Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer bag.</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Cook frozen sandwiches until golden, about 5 minutes. If sandwiches are thawed, cook 3 minutes at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
